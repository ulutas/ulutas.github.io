          <strong>Responsibility for Purchases:</strong> You are responsible for
          all activities and purchases associated with your anonymous App
          identity. Ensure the security of your device, as this is how your
          anonymous identity and associated purchases are maintained. In case of
          device loss or change, we cannot guarantee the transfer of your
          purchases if the anonymous identifier cannot be restored or linked.
