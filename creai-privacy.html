    <p><strong>Effective date: January 23, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to CreAI App!</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of CreAI App (“CreAI”)
      in connection with the CreAI App mobile application (the “App”).

      the collection and processing of your personal data on the terms specified
      below.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains when, where, how, and why we collect personal
      information about you, how we use the information, the conditions under
      which we may disclose it to others, your rights in respect of your
      personal information, as well as how we keep it secure.
    </p>

    <p>
      By registering for, downloading, or using our services, you accept this
      Privacy Policy, which is part of our Terms of Use. We may modify this
      Privacy Policy from time to time.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

    <p>First of all (Questions & Answers);</p>

    <p>
      Q: What face data does your app collect? <br />
      A: CreAI App collects images of your face, including details of your eyes,
      nose, hair, mouth, skin, and other facial features necessary to train an
      AI model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: How do we use the collected face data? <br />
      A: With this artificial intelligence model, we replace your face with the
      faces in the photo for entertainment purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Will the data be shared with any third parties? Where will this
      information be stored? <br />
      A: Your facial data and photos are not shared with any third party and are
      securely stored temporarily on our servers using AWS and Google Cloud
      services for storage purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: How long will the face data be retained? <br />
      A: Once the AI ​​model finishes creating the photos, your facial data is
      immediately deleted.
    </p>

    <p>We collect from you the following data:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>a. Information you provide us directly.</strong> When you use our
      Services, we collect the information that you provide us directly:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Photos.</strong> We may collect the photos, that you take with
      your camera while using our application and photos, that you upload to our
      application from your device. Please note, you won’t be able to upload
      content from your camera unless we can access your device’s camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Facial features.</strong> We may collect the facial feature data
      separately from your photos only to provide you with the face-swapping
      functionality of CreAI App. Please note, we collect facial feature data
      that is not biometric data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>b. Usage data.</strong> When you use our Services, we may collect
      information about your activity within our Services, for example, which
      pages you have viewed and for how long. We also may collect IP addresses,
      the source of the traffic, information regarding the device and operating
      system, information about your wireless and mobile network connections,
      unique device identifiers, IDFA, region, browser type, language, battery
      level, and time zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect usage data with the help of Google Analytics App Event Tracking
      system. With the use of them, we collect such data as IP-Address, your
      device model, screen resolution and operation system, session durations,
      your location. Based on these data, we analyze your needs and interests,
      evaluate the effectiveness of our campaigns and improve our Website to
      make its content relevant to you and the Website itself available for
      smooth viewing with your device.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>c. Cookies and similar technologies.</strong> Like most online
      services and mobile applications, we may use cookies — tiny pieces of code
      that remain in your device after you have visited any websites and online
      services. When you use that website or application the next time, these
      pieces enable their owners to provide you with information customized for
      your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use cookies for authentication purposes only. When you access the
      Services or content, CreAI App uses session cookies, meaning that if you
      close the Services, cookies expire and no longer have any effect. You
      shall specifically agree to our use of cookies when you use our Services
      by clicking the respective button in the notification.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use the Services, we may also use technologies like pixels, web
      beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use CreAI
      App and provide features to you.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      CreAI does not use your photos and facial features for any reason other
      than to provide you with the face-swapping functionality of CreAI. In no
      way will CreAI use your photos and facial features for face recognition,
      as CreAI does not introduce the face recognition technologies or other
      technical means for the processing of biometric data for the unique
      identification or authentication of a user.
    </p>

    <p>We may use the information other than photos or facial features to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Services;
      </li>
      <li>perform troubleshooting, diagnose or fix technology problems;</li>
      <li>enhance the safety and security of the Services;</li>
      <li>monitor and analyze trends and usage;</li>
      <li>develop and test new features of the Services;</li>
      <li>
        understand your needs and provide services and advertisements that are
        relevant to you;
      </li>
      <li>
        use the information we’ve collected from cookies and similar
        technologies to enhance our Services and your experience with them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Uploaded Content is collected for its display in the library for the
      user’s repeated use and convenience of the Services usage. Uploaded
      Content is stored on the device and cloud for a specific period of time
      and displayed to you exclusively during your use of the Services. By
      submitting this content for the swapping you expressly agree for its
      collection and storage as set forth herein. In no way will CreAI use your
      Uploaded Content for face recognition, as CreAI does not introduce the
      face recognition technologies or other technical means for processing of
      biometric data for the unique identification or authentication of a user.
    </p>

    <p>
      If CreAI decides to change the purposes of processing specified above, we
      will inform you on such changes prior to use your personal information
      within the newly set purposes and ask for your separate consent if
      required by the applicable laws.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>
      In order to provide high-quality Services, CreAI hires people, may enter
      agreements with independent contractors as well as cooperates with other

      of all, our employees may have access to your data. Then, we may transfer
      your data to our sub-contractors and affiliates.
    </p>

    <p>
      CreAI uses only secure places of storage, such as Google Cloud and Amazon
      Web Services. Google LLC is located in the United States of America and
      complies with the requirements of the EU-US Privacy Shield. Here is some
      information on the data protection practices of Google LLC. Amazon Web
      Services Inc is located in the United States of America and complies with

      information is being protected and used only within the purposes specified
      in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. This is achieved by using only
      certified services and products, signing agreements on protection of
      personal data and non-disclosure agreements with contractors as well as
      taking technical measures to ensure the information is protected when
      stored, used, and while being transferred.
